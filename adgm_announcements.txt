This is an external communication and is not an official statement or announcement from ADGM.

Leon Black, the esteemed founder of Apollo Global Management and a leading figure in private equity with a net worth in excess of $14 billion, has established a new branch of his family office, Elysium Management, at Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). This strategic move underscores Black’s deep ties with the region, cultivated over 30 years through his leadership at Apollo, a global alternative asset manager with nearly $700bn under management currently and reflects his growing commitment to making a deeper push within the region.

The new office, Scimitar, will serve as Elysium's first international office. Scimitar has brought on a team of seasoned professionals, including Abu Dhabi-based financier Asad Hussaini. Hussaini, alongside Black’s son Ben, will build out the credit platform Fortinbras.

Black, known not only for his financial acumen but also for his passion as a philanthropist and prolific art collector, highlighted the significance of his long-standing relationship with Abu Dhabi. “I’ve long admired and respected the people of Abu Dhabi who are at the core of driving the development of UAE and the entire Gulf Region,” Black said in a statement. “I’ve been coming here for more than 30 years and the growth and prosperity that has occurred under Abu Dhabi’s visionary leadership is truly remarkable. My family office wants to be a part of that transformation and, more importantly, be an active member of this community. Having an office with local executives leading it is critical to our strategy and demonstrates our commitment.”

ADGM, the International Financial Centre of the UAE’s capital, Abu Dhabi, welcomed this move. "We are delighted to welcome Mr. Leon Black and Elysium Management to ADGM. Mr. Black brings with him a wealth of experience and an unwavering commitment to excellence, further contributing to our thriving ecosystem. This move not only reflects the deep ties between Mr. Black and the region but also underscores the importance of ADGM as a strategic base for leading global family offices. The establishment of the first international office for Elysium highlights Abu Dhabi as the destination of choice for global entities to grow their businesses and expand within the MEASA region and beyond."

Elysium Management’s expansion into the ADGM, coupled with its seasoned team and strategic leadership, signals a new chapter in the firm’s global ambitions, positioning it at the heart of one of the world’s most influential financial centres.

Title: Proposed Regulatory Framework for the issuance of Fiat-Referenced Tokens

Proposed Regulatory Framework for the issuance of Fiat-Referenced Tokens
ADGM FSRA 20/08/2024

The Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) has published Consultation Paper No. 7 of 2024 containing proposals to enhance its regulatory framework to allow the issuance of Fiat-Referenced Tokens (FRTs) from the ADGM and invites public feedback and comments on the proposals.

FRTs are a category of stablecoins that are backed by high-quality, liquid assets denominated in the same currency as the FRT and that can be liquidated rapidly with minimal adverse price effect. FRTs are intended to be used as a means of payment and share certain characteristics with Stored Value.

Since the introduction of its original regulatory framework in 2018 for digital assets, the FSRA’s treatment of them has evolved significantly to reflect advances in this area. While the most recent version of the FSRA’s “Guidance - Regulation of Virtual Asset Activities in ADGM” (December 2023) discussed stablecoins in general and distinguished them from Virtual Assets, the FSRA’s legislation will now specifically address FRTs and their issuance.

The FSRA is proposing to adopt a risk-based and proportionate approach to FRT issuance in response to industry demand, based on appropriate regulatory requirements that incorporate the necessary safeguards to ensure that FRT issuers operate in a safe and sound manner and informed by current practices in leading jurisdictions. Issuance of FRTs would constitute a new Regulated Activity, distinct from the issuance of Stored Value within the Financial Services and Markets Regulations 2015 (“FSMR”), with commensurate conduct of business and prudential requirements.

The consultation period will close on 3 October 2024.

ADGM Continues Rapid Growth, Issues 1,271 New Licences in H1 2024: Assets Under Management Increase by 226%
ADGM 14/08/2024
A surge of 226% in Assets Under Management was reported in H1 2024 compared to H1 2023.

The number of new licences grew by 20.5% compared to H1 2023.

ADGM Al Reem Island Expansion fuels a residential surge with the island’s occupancy rate reaching more than 92% at the end of June 2024.

ADGM, the international financial centre (IFC) of the UAE’s capital, continues its impressive growth trajectory, reporting exceptional performance in the first half of 2024. As the fastest-growing financial centre and the only jurisdiction with the direct application of the English Common Law in the region, ADGM’s consistent achievements and strategic initiatives are a catalyst to the growth of Abu Dhabi’s financial sector growth.

The momentum of ADGM bolsters the financial sector's contribution to Abu Dhabi’s non-oil economy, which grew to 9.7% in Q1 2024. ADGM is increasingly becoming a global magnet for asset management firms, outstanding talent, and investments, and is a cornerstone in cementing Abu Dhabi’s position as the ‘Capital of Capital’.

Commenting on ADGM’s continued growth and strong performance, H.E. Ahmed Jasim Al Zaabi, Chairman of ADGM said, "As a catalyst for Abu Dhabi’s financial sector, ADGM’s remarkable growth in the first half of 2024 fosters Abu Dhabi's position as a premiere hub and a destination of choice for global, regional and local corporations and financial institutions. ADGM's strategies have been aligned with Abu Dhabi's visionary leadership to position the UAE's capital as a leading international financial centre.

He added, “ADGM's contribution to Abu Dhabi's stature as a global financial powerhouse and its sustainable economic growth will continue to capitalise on opportunities that will further elevate Abu Dhabi’s Falcon Economy to unprecedented heights throughout this exceptionally successful year and beyond.”

Surge in Operational Entities and New Licences Reflect Strong Growth

One of the factors that has supported ADGM’s strong growth in H1 2024 is the significant increase in operational entities, which have risen to 2,088, including 231 financial services entities – a 31% increase in operational entities compared to H1 2023. This growth is also complemented by the number of Financial Services Permissions (FSP) granted in the first six months, equivalent to 42 – a growth of over 90% compared to the June 2023 numbers which stood at 22.

Moreover, the number of licences issued at the end of June 2024 showcased 1,271 new licences - 20.5% more licences than a year earlier.

Financial Services Sector Led by Asset Management Positions Abu Dhabi as the Region’s Financial Hub

The asset management sector within ADGM continues to thrive, with a notable surge in AUM, global asset managers, firms and funds being anchored. In the first six months of 2024, AUM grew by 226% compared to the same period last year. By the end of June 2024, the number of fund and asset managers operating in ADGM reached 112, managing 141 funds.

Some of the major names within the asset management sector that have been granted an FSP include AXA IM, Eiffel Investment ME, GQG Partners, SS&C Financial Services, and Morgan Stanley. Furthermore, several entities within this space have also received their In-Principle Approval (IPA) including Aspen Digital, Blantyre Capital, Blue Owl, Fiera Capital, Infini Capital, I Squared Capital, Ninety One Gulf Capital, Peninsula, Token Bay Capital, Triton, and Vizier. The pipeline of entities within the asset management sector remains strong across hedge funds, private equity, institutional funds and venture capital firms set to be anchored in ADGM.

While asset management continues to lead the growth of ADGM, additional financial services entities across banking, payment services, wealth management and insurance sectors have also joined the ADGM ecosystem by receiving either an FSP or an IPA. The list of granted FSPs within these sectors includes Barrenjoey, Deutsche Bank AG, Fidelis OPCO, Laser Digital, and Paxos Issuance MENA. Prominent list of names that received an IPA includes Oyster Reinsurance Brokers, and SMBC Bank International, among others.

In May 2024, ADGM hosted the second edition of the UAE-France Investors Meetup – an exclusive gathering, led by His Excellency Bruno Le Maire, the French Minister of Economy, Finance, and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty and attended by 24 French Asset Management firms with USD 1.6 Trillion AUM. The Meetup represented a unique opportunity for stakeholders in both countries to forge strategic alliances, identify new opportunities, and drive mutual growth. It reaffirmed Abu Dhabi’s position as a global financial hub and underscored the enduring strength of the Franco-Emirati partnership.

Bringing Abu Dhabi to the World: International Roadshows Meet Unprecedented Demand

In its efforts to continue expanding its international positioning, ADGM conducted a series of roadshows in the first half of 2024, covering multiple countries and regions including the USA, Europe, Hong Kong and the Chinese subcontinent.

In the USA, ADGM engaged in over 40 bilateral discussions with hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture capital firms at the iConnections Global Alts 2024. In Europe, ADGM held over 100 bilateral discussions with senior leaders in the Private Banking, Wealth Management, Private Equity, VC and Hedge Fund sectors in France, Switzerland, and other European hubs. These engagements occurred amidst the surge of global wealth into the UAE and included participation in renowned international events such as the 2024 IIF European Summit in Paris and the JP Morgan Global Markets Conference.

The roadshow in China and Hong Kong concluded successfully, with strategic meetings involving 75 entities. Discussions focused on cross-border regulatory cooperation with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, expansion plans for several Hong Kong and Chinese firms in Abu Dhabi, and the enhancement of liquidity strategies in both regions. The engagement also featured the ADIO-organised Shanghai Investment Summit, where the announcement of a new trade forum – ‘The UAE-China Summit presented by HSBC’ - was announced. This summit is set to be a sub-event of the upcoming Abu Dhabi Finance Week (ADFW) in December.

Leading the Path for Sustainable Finance and ESG in the Region

Following the introduction of the region’s first comprehensive Sustainable Finance framework in 2023, the Registration Authority (RA) and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of ADGM have proposed enhancements to these regulations. A discussion paper published in May 2024 invited input from industry experts including fund managers, asset managers and companies subject to the Companies Regulations 2020. These proposed enhancements provide greater clarity around the FSRA's requirements for ESG-labelled investment products that pursue broader sustainability objectives than only environmental. It also fosters demand for "green" products and services by aiming to provide investors with confidence that the risk of greenwashing has been addressed. Additionally, the consultation paper invites discussions around ADGM’s role in encouraging ADGM-based entities to identify and address climate-related risks to their businesses and develop their net-zero transition plans that support the UAE’s Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative.

The RA of ADGM has also taken several initiatives in its efforts towards promoting best practices in ESG in the first six months of 2024. It has successfully launched the ESG Disclosures Framework micropage as well as an ESG Questionnaire Survey to understand the preparedness of ADGM-licensed entities for the framework.

ADGM at the Forefront of Blockchain Innovation

Following the introduction of the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Foundations Regulations, ADGM has signed strategic partnerships with a couple of organisations in 2024.

The first one was with the Solana Foundation, a non-profit organisation dedicated to decentralisation, adoption, and security on the Solana network to enhance DLT solutions and advance blockchain innovation. Another Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between ADGM and Hacken, a global leader in blockchain security auditing to collaboratively set new benchmarks for blockchain security and compliance as well as on-chain monitoring solutions in relation to ADGM’s DLT Foundations framework, positioning both organisations at the forefront of fostering a secure blockchain ecosystem.

These initiatives align with ADGM’s strategic vision of becoming a central hub for technology-driven financial services.

ADGM’s Workforce Booms Amid Abu Dhabi’s Growing Appeal with more than 2,500 New Jobs

Sustained investments across various sectors in Abu Dhabi have led to a strong performance in the Global Liveability Index 2024 published by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Abu Dhabi is the highest-ranked city in the MENA region, This ranking highlights Abu Dhabi’s strengths in factors such as stability, infrastructure and education.

ADGM is further enhancing its attractiveness as a preferred destination for professionals and investors alike. The workforce within ADGM’s Al Maryah Island has increased by more than 2,500 individuals, compared to the end of June 2023, and are now part of ADGM’s vibrant community.

Furthermore, the workforce number is expected to maintain strong growth in 2024 in line with the positive responses received from a comprehensive outlook survey conducted in the first half. A total of 70.81% of companies anticipate expanding their workforce in ADGM during 2024, with 29.93% expecting significant increases and 40.88% planning moderate growth in staffing.

ADGM’s Al Reem Island Expansion Fuels a Residential Surge

Since the announcement of the expansion in April 2023, Al Reem Island has seen the introduction of 1,266 new residential units, bringing the total to 21,335 units. The growth in occupancy rates has remained steady, rising from 84.78% in March 2023 to 92.82% by the end of June 2024. Moreover, with ADGM’s exceptional growth, many employees of the new companies established within ADGM’s jurisdiction are choosing Al Reem Island as their place of residence. ADGM's jurisdiction over both Al Maryah and Al Reem Island highlights its exceptional qualities, making it an ideal location to live, work, and conduct business.

ADGM Pioneers Seamless Business Migration in Al Reem Island

The first half of 2024 marks a significant phase in ADGM’s Al Reem Island transition post-expansion and brings forward various factors that are facilitating this process. Several initiatives, along with periodic awareness activities, have been conducted. A recent initiative includes revisions to ADGM’s licensing fee schedule, aligning with the transitional arrangements to Al Reem Island. Major reductions of 50 per cent and more to obtaining non-financial and retail licences within ADGM’s jurisdiction will take effect from 1st January 2025.

In addition to regulatory amendments supporting existing Al Reem Island businesses, ADGM has launched an information centre in Shams Boutik Mall and organised two community events in 2024, one in March and another in July. These initiatives were implemented to engage with the Al Reem Island business community, provide essential updates on licensing, registration fees, and transition processes as well as foster interactive dialogue and collaboration among stakeholders. ADGM also introduced an incentive initiative for existing non-financial and retail businesses on Al Reem Island, exempting them from paying any fees for obtaining an ADGM commercial licence providing they apply before 31st October 2024.

These initiatives are ensuring a seamless transition for Al Reem Island businesses and have been well received by the business community.

Celebrating 40 Years of Bilateral Cooperation: UAE-China Summit presented by HSBC Announced During ADGM's China Roadshow
ADGM 07/08/2024
The plans for the ‘UAE-China Summit,’ presented by HSBC’, which is set to be a part of the upcoming ADFW in December, were unveiled during a series of more than 75 engagements with leading entities in Shanghai & Hong Kong.
Bilateral discussions during the roadshow will lead to cross-border regulatory cooperation with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, expansion plans for several Hong Kong and Chinese firms in Abu Dhabi and the enhancement of liquidity strategies in each other's capital markets.
Significant Chinese financial institutions are at a stage of advanced exploration to establish within ADGM.

In its ongoing commitment to bolster Abu Dhabi’s global position and bilateral relations, ADGM, the international financial centre of the UAE capital, recently concluded a series of high-level engagements in China and participated in the Shanghai Investment Summit, organised by the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO) and attended by 200 industry and financial executives from China and Hong Kong.

The roadshow covered Shanghai and Hong Kong, featuring the announcement of a new trade forum – ‘The UAE-China Summit presented by HSBC’, slated to be one of the sub-events of the upcoming edition of Abu Dhabi Finance Week (ADFW) in December.

"The UAE-China Summit presented by HSBC’" will mark 40 years of diplomatic relations between the UAE and China, which aim to explore bilateral trade and investment opportunities further and drive the cultural exchange between both countries.

The series of roadshows, initially planned for three days, were extended to five days to accommodate the unprecedented demand for bilateral meetings and discussions. These meetings aimed to showcase Abu Dhabi’s economic opportunities and investment potential as the ‘Capital of Capital,’ and ADGM’s value proposition as the region's fastest-growing international financial centre.

Over 75 major financial institutions, including private equity firms, hedge funds, asset managers and family offices from Hong Kong and China actively engaged in strategic discussions with ADGM’s Leadership, including representatives from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of ADGM and other key ADGM executives. Discussions spanned cross-border regulatory cooperation with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, expansion plans in Abu Dhabi for various Hong Kong and Chinese firms, and strategies to enhance liquidity in each other's capital markets.

Arvind Ramamurthy, Chief of Market Development at ADGM said, "The enthusiastic response we received during the China and Hong Kong roadshows underscores Abu Dhabi’s growing international recognition. Along with ADGM, ADFW has been playing a pivotal role in carrying Abu Dhabi’s ‘Falcon Economy’ across global borders. The demand in the Chinese subcontinent is unprecedented, and both Abu Dhabi and ADGM are ready to embrace these opportunities, further strengthening the 40-year diplomatic relations between our strategically important nations."

Mohamed Al Marzooqi, Chief Executive Officer, UAE, HSBC Bank Middle East said: “Over the last decade, bilateral investment between the UAE and China has reached billions of dollars, with the UAE's non-oil trade with China reaching USD81 billion in 2023. As Abu Dhabi’s multi-year transformation plans accelerate and China’s pro-business policies bolster its status as a giant in international trade, and a global leader in renewables, we foresee a surge in both inbound and outbound business opportunities along the corridor. Our long-standing presence in both countries, extensive expertise and international network position us well to support businesses and institutions seeking to capture investment and financial flows along these two dynamic markets.”

In addition to finance, other prominent sectors such as healthcare, infrastructure, and construction acknowledged the exponential growth opportunities within Abu Dhabi. Companies in these sectors expressed strategic plans to expand their business operations in the emirate, with several firms already confirming their expansion plans into Abu Dhabi’s international financial centre.
